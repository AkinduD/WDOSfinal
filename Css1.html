                        <p>
                            When designing an eco house, sustainability is important. The objective is to create a home that lasts and has as
                            little impact as possible on the surrounding environment. Green construction materials are also more durable and over
                            time demand much less maintenance, making your home look newer for longer and saving money on expensive repairs.
                            This increased lifetime and little need for maintenance will also help will the environmental effect of your home
                            dramatically.

                        <p>
                            Many standard quality goods contain to some degree hazardous substances, whether in the materials from which they
                            are manufactured or used during the production process. The fact that eco friendly products are free of these toxic 
                            additives, finishes and possible environmental toxins is one of the main advantages of choosing these types of 
                            products. This makes them safer to build with and creates your family's healthier home climate.
